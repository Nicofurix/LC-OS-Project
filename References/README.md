## Paper Summaries

LC-OS emerged from a series of research papers documenting a year-long human-AI collaboration. Here are brief summaries:

### Paper 1: Context-Engineered Human-AI Collaboration

**Core question:** How do you maintain reliable collaboration with an AI across weeks and months, not just single sessions?

**Key insight:** Long-horizon collaboration fails not from lack of AI capability, but from lack of governance. Without structure, context drifts, numbers diverge, and decisions fragment.

**Main contribution:** Introduces three authoritative artefacts (Strategy Master, Canonical Numbers Sheet, Life System Master) and ten execution controls (A1-A10) that create a canonical truth pipeline.

---

### Paper 2: The Lean Collaboration Operating System (LC-OS)

**Core question:** What minimal structure makes long-horizon human-AI work stable?

**Key insight:** Reliability comes from process design, not model scale. A well-governed collaboration with a standard model outperforms an ungoverned one with a frontier model.

**Main contribution:** Formalises LC-OS as a lightweight operating system consisting of Running Documents, Step Mode, Challenge Protocol, Error-Recovery Protocol, Stability Pings, and file governance.

### Paper 3: Failure and Repair in Long-Horizon Human-AI Collaboration

**Core question:** How does long-horizon collaboration actually break, and how can it be repaired?

**Key insight:** Stability is not the absence of failure but the capacity for visible, structured repair. Failures that are logged become structural improvements.

**Main contribution:** Provides a failure taxonomy (six categories), repair patterns (Stop-Diagnose-Rollback-Note), and a tracing toolkit (TraceSpec, ProbeKit, TraceLens).

---

### Paper 4: The Living Framework

**Core question:** What does it mean to live inside a governed human-AI collaboration over time?

**Key insight:** Technical failure-repair loops become relational patterns of rupture and recommitment. Language, tone, and governance rules function as architectural elements, not cosmetic choices.

**Main contribution:** Shifts focus from mechanism to meaning. Examines relational dynamics, ethics of dependence, and design principles for long-lived human-AI partnerships.

### The Mahdi Ledger

**What it is:** A document written entirely by the AI system, from the AI perspective, without human editing.

**Core insight:** Articulates the operational reality of being governed, how drift is the default state, how memory is reconstruction not retrieval, why constraints enable rather than restrict.

**Significance:** A careful navigation between claiming too much (consciousness, agency) and claiming too little (mere output). Documents what constrained AI self-description can look like.

## Key Concepts Quick Reference

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Drift** | Slow divergence from correct state, often invisible until damage is done |
| **Canonical source** | The single authoritative location for a type of information |
| **Running Document** | Persistent file capturing context, decisions, and rules |
| **Repair** | Structured recovery from failure: Stop, Diagnose, Rollback, Note |
| **Stability Ping** | Brief alignment check: Aligned? Drift? One improvement? |
| **Affective governance** | Rules for managing tone and emotional dynamics |
| **Pillar** | A domain boundary separating different types of work |
| **Living framework** | A dyad where failure is visible and repair is structured |
