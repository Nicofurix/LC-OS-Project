# Stability Ping

**What this is:** A brief alignment check performed after major milestones or at regular intervals. Catches drift before it compounds.

**When to use it:** 
- After completing a significant piece of work
- When starting a new phase
- After a repair sequence
- Weekly, if working intensively
- Whenever something feels slightly "off" but you can't name it

**Time required:** 5 minutes

## The Three Questions

A Stability Ping asks three questions:

### 1. Are we still aligned?

Check whether human and AI are working toward the same goal with the same understanding.

- Is the current focus still correct?
- Are we using the same definitions and constraints?
- Has the goal shifted without being acknowledged?

**What misalignment looks like:**
- AI is optimising for something slightly different than intended
- Assumptions have diverged without explicit discussion
- The work feels productive but isn't moving toward the actual goal

---

### 2. Has any drift appeared?

Look for small deviations that haven't yet caused failures but might.

- Are numbers being referenced correctly?
- Is context from the Running Document still being applied?
- Has tone or style shifted?
- Are boundaries being respected?

**What drift looks like:**
- Slightly different phrasing of established rules
- Small numerical inconsistencies
- Tone becoming more casual or more formal than agreed
- Scope creeping without explicit approval

---

### 3. What one improvement could we make before continuing?

Identify one small structural fix that would make the next phase more stable.

- A rule that should be added to the Running Document
- A number that should be added to Canonical Numbers
- A clarification of scope or boundaries
- A reference document that should be linked

**Constraint:** Only one. The goal is continuous small improvement, not a major overhaul.

## Stability Ping Template

Copy and use this template:

```
## Stability Ping — [Date]

### 1. Alignment Check
- Current focus: [What we're working on]
- Goal still correct? [Yes/No/Needs adjustment]
- Shared understanding confirmed? [Yes/No]

### 2. Drift Check  
- Numbers consistent? [Yes/No — if no, what's drifting?]
- Context being applied? [Yes/No — if no, what's being forgotten?]
- Tone appropriate? [Yes/No — if no, what's shifted?]
- Boundaries respected? [Yes/No — if no, where's the creep?]

### 3. One Improvement
- [Specific small change to make before continuing]

### Status
- [✓ Stable — proceed] or [⚠ Adjustment needed — specify]
```

## Worked Example

```
## Stability Ping — January 28, 2025

### 1. Alignment Check
- Current focus: Drafting February editorial calendar
- Goal still correct? Yes
- Shared understanding confirmed? Yes — both clear on 3x weekly cadence

### 2. Drift Check  
- Numbers consistent? No — AI mentioned "£70 per article" when rate is now £75
- Context being applied? Yes
- Tone appropriate? Yes
- Boundaries respected? Yes

### 3. One Improvement
- Re-confirm Canonical Numbers at start of next session; add verbal reminder to check rates

### Status
- ⚠ Minor adjustment needed — corrected rate drift, will reinforce Canonical Numbers reference
```

## When to Do More Than a Ping

A Stability Ping is a quick check, not a deep audit. 

Escalate beyond a ping if:

- Multiple drift signals appear at once
- The same drift has appeared before
- Alignment cannot be confirmed quickly
- Trust feels compromised

In these cases, consider:

- A full re-read of the Running Document together
- A Repair Protocol sequence
- A longer working session focused on re-establishing foundations

## Integrating Pings Into Your Workflow

**Option 1: Milestone-based**
Do a Stability Ping after each significant deliverable or phase completion.

**Option 2: Time-based**
Do a Stability Ping at the start of each week (for intensive projects) or each month (for slower projects).

**Option 3: Intuition-based**
Do a Stability Ping whenever something feels slightly off, even if you can't articulate why.

All three approaches work. Choose based on your project rhythm.

## Why This Works

Drift is slow and invisible. By the time it causes a visible failure, significant correction is needed.

Stability Pings interrupt this pattern by creating regular visibility:

- Small deviations are caught early
- Alignment is confirmed, not assumed
- The system improves continuously through "one improvement" accumulation

Over time, Stability Pings become fast (under 5 minutes) because the check becomes habitual and the system becomes genuinely stable.

*Aligned? Any drift? One improvement?*

*That's all it takes.*
