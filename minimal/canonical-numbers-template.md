# Canonical Numbers

**What this is:** The single source of truth for all numerical data in your project. The AI references this file — it doesn't recalculate from memory or conversation history.

**How to use it:** Any number that matters goes here. When you or the AI need a figure, it comes from this document. If a number isn't here, it's not authoritative.

**Why this matters:** AI systems are prone to numerical drift — recalculating values slightly differently each time, mixing currencies, or inventing plausible-sounding figures. This file eliminates that class of error entirely.

## How to Maintain This File

1. **Add numbers as they're confirmed** — not before
2. **Include units and currency** — always explicit, never assumed
3. **Date entries when relevant** — numbers can change; track when
4. **Mark superseded values** — don't delete history, mark it [SUPERSEDED]
5. **Reference this file in your Running Document** — so the AI knows where to look

## Conversion Rates (if applicable)

If your project involves multiple currencies or units, lock conversion rates here rather than letting the AI look them up dynamically.

| From | To | Rate | Fixed on | Notes |

## Superseded Values

When a number changes, move the old value here rather than deleting it. This creates an audit trail.
