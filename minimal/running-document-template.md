## Project Overview

**Project name:**  
Q1 Content Strategy Overhaul

**Start date:**  
January 8, 2025

**Current phase:**  
Execution — publishing phase

**Primary goal:**  
Redesign the blog content pipeline to publish 3x weekly with consistent quality.

---

## Active Context

**Current focus:**  
Finalising the editorial calendar for February and drafting the first two feature posts.

**Key constraints:**  
- Budget: £500/month for freelance support
- Timeline: Full pipeline operational by Feb 15
- Must integrate with existing CMS (WordPress)

**Open questions:**  
- Should we hire a part-time editor or continue self-editing?
- Is 3x weekly sustainable long-term, or should we target 2x?

---

## Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Status |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Jan 10 | Focus on evergreen content first | Evergreen has longer shelf life, better ROI | Active |
| Jan 12 | Use Notion for editorial calendar | Already in our stack, avoids new tool | Active |
| Jan 15 | Delay video content to Q2 | Bandwidth too limited this quarter | Active |

---

## Rules & Agreements

- All draft posts reviewed before scheduling (no direct publish)
- AI assists with outlines and first drafts, human does final edit
- Any budget decision over £100 requires explicit approval
- We don't publish on weekends — scheduling only Mon/Wed/Fri

---

## Corrections & Lessons

| Date | What went wrong | How it was fixed | What changed |
|------|-----------------|------------------|--------------|
| Jan 14 | AI drafted post using outdated brand voice guidelines | Provided updated guidelines, re-drafted | Added "brand voice doc" to references section |
| Jan 18 | Confusion about which post was "final" — two versions existed | Deleted duplicate, established naming convention | All drafts now named [Topic]_v[X]_[Date] |

---

## Session Notes

**Jan 20:**  
Reviewed February calendar. Identified gap in week 3 — need one more topic. Discussed potential: either "beginner's guide to X" or "case study Y". Decision deferred to next session.

**Jan 22:**  
Chose "beginner's guide to X" for week 3. AI to draft outline by end of session. Also noted that Friday posts get less engagement — may revisit schedule in March.
